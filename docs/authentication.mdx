description: Learn about API key types and how to authenticate requests.

All API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_key_here
```

## API Key Types

StashFyle supports two types of API keys:

### Secret Keys (`sk_`)

<Info>
  **Use for:** Server-side applications, backend services, scripts
</Info>

- Full access to all API endpoints
- Can upload private files
- Can generate signed URLs
- **Never expose in client-side code**

```
sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Public Keys (`pk_`)

<Info>
  **Use for:** Browser uploads, mobile apps, client-side code
</Info>

- Limited to upload endpoint only
- Requires CORS origin configuration
- Cannot access private files or signed URLs
- Safe to use in frontend code

```
pk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Creating API Keys

1. Go to [API Keys](https://stashfyle.com/api-keys) in your dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Choose the key type (Secret or Public)
4. Optionally add a name and allowed origins (for public keys)
5. Copy your key immediately—it won't be shown again

## Using Public Keys with CORS

When using a public key from a browser, you must configure allowed origins:

1. Edit your public key in the dashboard
2. Add your domain(s) to **Allowed Origins**
3. Include the full origin: `https://yourapp.com`

```javascript
// Browser upload with public key
const form = new FormData();
form.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

await fetch('https://api.stashfyle.com/v1/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer pk_live_xxx' },
  body: form
});
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose secret keys">
    Secret keys should only be used in server-side code. Use environment variables and never commit keys to version control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use public keys for browsers">
    For client-side uploads, always use public keys with properly configured CORS origins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    If you suspect a key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and create a new one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for environments">
    Create different keys for development, staging, and production.
