## What Happens at Limits?

### Storage Limit

When you exceed your storage limit, new uploads will fail with:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "storage_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Storage limit exceeded"
  }
}
```

Delete files or upgrade your plan to continue uploading.

### File Size Limit

Files larger than your plan's limit will be rejected:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "file_too_large",
    "message": "File exceeds maximum size of 10MB"
  }
}
```

### Upload Count

Monthly upload counts reset on the 1st of each month (UTC). Exceeding the limit returns a storage limit error.

## Checking Your Usage

View your current usage in the [Dashboard](https://stashfyle.com/dashboard) or via API:

```bash
curl https://api.stashfyle.com/v1/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxx"
```

```json
{
  "storage_bytes": 524288000,
  "bandwidth_bytes": 1073741824,
  "upload_count": 150,
  "period_start": "2024-01-01"
}
```

## Upgrading

1. Go to [Billing](https://stashfyle.com/billing) in your dashboard
2. Select your new plan
3. Complete payment via Stripe
4. New limits take effect immediately

## Downgrading

When downgrading to a lower plan:

- If you're under the new plan's limits, the change takes effect at the end of your billing period
- If you're over the new plan's limits, you'll enter a **14-day grace period** to reduce your usage
- During grace period, uploads are disabled but downloads work normally
- After grace period, files exceeding the limit are deleted (largest files first)

<Warning>
  Before downgrading, check your current storage usage against the target plan's limits.
</Warning>

## Annual Billing

Save money with annual billing:

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Savings |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Hobby | $9/mo | $7.50/mo | 17% off |
| Pro | $29/mo | $22/mo | 24% off |
